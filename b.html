        <h2>How Does DNS Work?</h2>
        <p>When a user enters a URL into their browser, DNS goes to work connecting the URL to the IP address of the current server. This is called DNS name resolution and involves a DNS resource lining up several name servers to decipher the actual IP address of a server..</p>

        <h2>How do DNS records work?</h2>
        <p>The domain name system (DNS) makes it possible for a user to access the website they want by simply typing the name of a domain in the browser. Network drives actually communicate using IP addresses, which, however, are long and complicated. Therefore, the user only has to type the name of the website, which is automatically translated into numerical sequence format. But how is this translation produced?</p>

        <h2>How Does the Name Server (DNS) Work?</h2>
        <p>After talking for a long time about the web system and the mail system, I see it as fundamental and complementary to these to open a new how it works to talk about the naming system (or DNS) that allows names like altenwald.com to be translated into IP addresses through a query to A server. You know how it works?</p>

        <h2>What types of DNS records can I configure?</h2>
        <p>The types of DNS records that you can configure on your domain are:

             A: points to an IP. The destination server is responsible for processing the incoming request. You must take into account whether the destination IP is fixed or dynamic. Example: 192.168.1.104
             AAAA: it is a type of record similar to the previous one, since it also points to an IP. They differ in that they point to an IPv6 IP address. Example: 2001:0dd8:85a3:08d3:1319:8a2e:0370:7334
             CNAME: points to another domain or another subdomain. Example: blog.example.com</p>

        <h2>What are DNS server names?</h2>
        <p>The server names determine who will handle the requests made to the domain regarding various services such as web, email, among others. It is also part of the Domain Name System (DNS), which maintains a directory of domains and their respective IP addresses. This means that when a user visits a domain, a DNS lookup is done to verify the server name and DNS settings.</p>
